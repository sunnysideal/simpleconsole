Simple Console Skin for weewx

This project started with wf-js-console which was intended to be a javascript, fully browser based, clean looking console for use with the WeatherFlow API when I had a Tempest personal weather station, and was a way of me teaching myself some JS and CSS.

I have changed my weather station (to Ecowitt) and use WeeWx so figured I would transfer all my work to use data from WeeWx instead.

The forecast requires an OpenWeather API key (Add it in the Extras section of skin.conf).

I still don't have all the components for my weather station, so until that time I am missing rain, UV and wind data.
